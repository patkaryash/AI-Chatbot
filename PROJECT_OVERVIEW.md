# Project Overview

## What This Project Does

This is a developer-focused real-time chat platform with AI assistance built into the conversation. It features a helpful, general-purpose AI assistant. Developers can create direct chats with other registered users, exchange live messages, reply to specific messages, soft-delete their own messages, reload complete message history after login, and call the AI assistant in the same thread by starting a message with `@ai`.

## Architecture

```text
React Frontend
  | Axios REST calls: auth, chat creation, history loading
  | Socket.IO events: live chat creation and messages
  v
Express Backend
  | Auth middleware validates JWT
  | Chat controllers expose REST fallbacks
  | Socket handlers manage user rooms and chat rooms
  v
MongoDB
  | users
  | chats
  | messages
  v
AI Service
  | Gemini when configured
  | local fallback for interview demos
```

## Main Modules

- `frontend/src/screens/Home.jsx`: dashboard, chat list, developer picker, message thread, and live socket integration.
- `frontend/src/config/axios.jsx`: shared API client.
- `frontend/src/config/socket.js`: Socket.IO client factory.
- `backend/routes/chat.routes.js`: authenticated REST routes for chats and messages.
- `backend/controllers/chat.controller.js`: chat creation, history loading, and HTTP message fallback.
- `backend/services/chat.service.js`: persistence and validation for chats/messages.
- `backend/services/socket.service.js`: WebSocket authentication, rooms, broadcasting, and `@ai` handling.
- `backend/services/ai.service.js`: Gemini integration plus local fallback response.
- `backend/models/chat.model.js`: chat participants and last-message summary.
- `backend/models/message.model.js`: persisted chat messages.

## Chat Flow

1. A logged-in user opens the dashboard.
2. The frontend loads `/users/developers` and `/chat`.
3. The user selects another developer and posts to `POST /chat`.
4. The backend creates or returns the existing one-to-one chat.
5. The backend emits `chat:created` to both users' private rooms.
6. When either user opens the chat, the frontend emits `chat:join`.
7. The backend verifies that the socket user belongs to the chat before joining `chat:<chatId>`.
8. The frontend loads full history from `GET /chat/:chatId/messages`.

## Real-Time Message Flow

1. The sender emits `message:send` with `chatId`, `content`, and a client message id.
2. The backend verifies chat membership.
3. The message is saved to MongoDB.
4. The backend broadcasts `message:new` to `chat:<chatId>`.
5. The backend broadcasts `chat:updated` so sidebars show the latest message.
6. Duplicate client message ids are ignored, preventing accidental double sends during retries.

## AI Flow

1. A developer sends a message such as `@ai explain this code`.
2. The backend stores that user message like any other chat message.
3. The backend detects the `@ai` prefix and extracts the prompt.
4. The AI service calls Gemini if configured, otherwise it returns a local demo reply.
5. The AI reply is stored as a message with role `ai`.
6. The AI message is broadcast to the same chat room so both developers see it live.

## Key Challenges Solved

- Chat visibility for both participants: chats are stored with both user ids and emitted to each user's private room.
- Multi-user consistency: every socket must pass membership checks before joining a chat room.
- Real-time reliability: messages are persisted before broadcasting, so refreshes and reconnects recover the full thread.
- Duplicate prevention: client message ids are indexed per chat and reused sends return the existing message.
- Demo resilience: AI has a local fallback when Gemini credentials are unavailable.
- Complex Message Interactions: Implemented robust logic for message replies, maintaining references even when the original message is soft-deleted.
- Production Security & Deployment: Configured restrictive cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), secure cross-site cookies, request rate limiting, data sanitization, and strict input validation for safe public deployment.

## Interview Talking Points

- The system uses REST for durable operations such as loading chats and history, and WebSockets for low-latency live updates.
- Socket.IO rooms map naturally to chat ids, which keeps broadcasts scoped to the right participants.
- The AI assistant is treated as another message producer, so AI responses remain persistent, auditable, and visible to all chat members.
- The backend keeps chat logic, AI logic, and socket logic in separate modules to make the code easier to explain and extend.
